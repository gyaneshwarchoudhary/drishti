## Our Solution:
#### READ Feature:
Drishti's READ feature utilizes **Context based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology to convert text into context-based audio, enabling users to listen to text-based content such as mail, signboards, recipes, and more.
This feature ensures that visually impaired individuals can access and comprehend textual information in their environment effortlessly.
#### Scene Analysis:
Drishti provides a brief description of surroundings through **scene analysis, enhancing situational awareness for users**.
This capability allows users to gain a better understanding of their environment, improving their ability to navigate and interact with the world around them.
#### Vision-based Authorization System:
**Drishti has developed a unique and dynamic vision-based authorization system**, ensuring secure access to the device and its features.
This authentication mechanism utilizes advanced vision algorithms to authenticate users, providing a seamless and secure user experience.
#### Indoor Navigation System (INS):
Drishti's Indoor Navigation System (INS) assists users in navigating indoor environments with ease and efficiency.
By leveraging **real-time location data and custom navigation algorithms**, Drishti guides users through complex indoor spaces, enhancing their mobility and independence.
#### POV Vision Streaming Application:
Drishti offers a Point-of-View (POV) vision streaming application that enables **location-based volunteer selection with live location and video streaming**.
This feature allows visually impaired individuals to connect with volunteers within a specific radius, facilitating real-time assistance and support.
#### Multilingual Support:
**Drishti supports over 40 languages, including regional languages, ensuring accessibility for users worldwide**.
This multilingual support enhances the inclusivity of Drishti, catering to the diverse linguistic needs of visually impaired individuals across different regions.

## Connecting user and volunteers
To help with navigating, people can connect with visually challenged people within a radius of 100 meter to 1.5 kilometres. We respect these people's right to privacy, thus we only share information that is absolutely necessary. And through a video conversation with the user, the volunteers can assist them.
