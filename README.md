_"Empowering the blind to navigate a sightless world – because every journey begins with a step, even if taken in the dark."_

Drishti is an AI-powered smart glasses solution designed to empower the blind and visually impaired, offering real-time assistance in navigating the world around them. Through innovative features and community-building capabilities, Drishti aims to enhance accessibility and foster inclusivity.

## Leading Causes of Blindness

- Mascular Degeneartion
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts

### Statistics

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), approximately 2.2 billion people globally were predicted to be blind or visually impaired in 2019, with nearly 1 billion affected by avoidable or untreated conditions. In India, a 2015 survey found 1% of people aged 50 and over to be blind. The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness predicts a rise in vision impairment and blindness due to factors like aging populations and increasing diabetes prevalence. Efforts in global health policies, preventative measures, and accessible eye care are crucial to address these issues, especially as over 100 million people are predicted to suffer from blindness in the next decade. Monitoring and intervention are necessary to establish effective public health policies.

## Economic Burden to the Society

Based on the assumptions, the net loss of GNI due to blindness in India is INR 845 billion (Int$ 38.4 billion). Per capita net loss of GNI per blind person is INR 170,624 (Int$ 7,756). Net loss of Assistive technologies, including Envision Glasses, may be expensive, making them less accessible to individuals with lower incomes GNI due to blindness in adults and children is INR 832 billion and INR 13 billion respectively
Vision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with an estimate annual global productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion purchasing power parity. These figures far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment (estimated at about US$ 25 billion).

### Available Solutions in the Market

Envision Glasses are one of the AI powered smart glasses for those who are blind or low-vision. Among its many features, the most widely used are its text to speech capabilities which allow users to read mail, signboards, recipes and basically any text they might come across. Features like 'Find Objects' and 'Describe Scene' also provide users with a better sense of their surroundings.
Beyond reading text, Envision Glasses offer object recognition, scene description, banknote reading, and more, creating a comprehensive assistive tool.

But in terms of cost, it falls short. A typical person cannot afford its built-in costs or api costs.
The price of Envision Glasses is 2499 USD, or up to 2,00,000+ INR. To use it's service without interuption, monthly we have to pay 12,000+INR

These devices were primarily targeted at enterprise and industrial applications. The market for such specialized devices may be smaller compared to consumer electronics, and the lower production volume can contribute to higher unit costs.

# The Problem We Solved

Drishti, the AI-powered smart glasses for blind people, address a wide range of issues and greatly improve the lives of those who are blind or visually impaired. Drishti empowers users by offering real-time assistance in reading text and detecting items in their surroundings with its novel features like object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This promotes greater independence and autonomy among users. Drishti also creates a helpful community network by matching volunteers with blind people in a seamless manner. This helps with tasks that need human assistance, such navigating new places or obtaining visual information that is beyond the range of the glasses. Through tackling these obstacles, Drishti enhances accessibility and fosters inclusivity, ultimately empowering people with visual impairments to participate more actively in a range of daily activities.

Moreover, Drishti goes beyond mere functionality by fostering human connection in a fractured world. Through its innovative platform,Drishti facilitates real-time communication between blind individuals and volunteers, forging meaningful relationships and providing essential assistance when needed. In a society where empathy and support are often scarce commodities, Drishti stands as a testament to the transformative power of technology in uplifting the most vulnerable members of our community, illustrating that even in the darkest of times, innovation can illuminate the path towards a brighter future.

### Connecting user and volunteers

To help with navigating, people can connect with visually challenged people within a radius of 100 meter to 1.5 kilometres. We respect these people's right to privacy, thus we only share information that is absolutely necessary. And through a video conversation with the user, the volunteers can assist them. The ability for volunteers to create checkpoints in the surrounding areas is one of the application's best features. For instance, if there is road construction, the volunteer can mark the location and let the blinds here have an alert while they are travelling by.

## Hardware Specification

_Raspberry pi zero 2w_

The Raspberry Pi Zero is a compact and affordable single-board computer developed by the `Raspberry Pi Foundation`. The Pi Zero 2 W has been designed to be as flexible and compact as possible with mini connectors and an unpopulated 40-pin GPIO, allowing you to use only what your project requires

It has a Processor Broadcom BCM2710A1, 1GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU.
This is a significant upgrade from the single-core processor of the original Raspberry Pi Zero, offering up to 40% faster single-threaded performance and five times faster multi-threaded performance.





The Raspberry Pi Zero 2w used as the processing unit, able to do activities like machine learning, image processing, and other AI-related operations. It fits well with wearable technology because of its compact size.

_Respeaker audio pi-hat_

ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications. This means that you can build a more powerful and flexible voice product

The board is developed based on WM8960, a low power stereo codec. There are 2 microphones on both sides of the board for collecting sounds and it also provides 3 APA102 RGB LEDs, 1 User Button and 2 on-board Grove interfaces for expanding your applications. What is more, 3.5mm Audio Jack or JST 2.0 Speaker Out are both available for audio output.



In the context of AI smart glasses, the ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT could be utilized to capture and process voice commands or other audio inputs. This is particularly useful if the smart glasses incorporate a voice-controlled interface for hands-free operation
