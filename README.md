_"Empowering the blind to navigate a sightless world â€“ because every journey begins with a step, even if taken in the dark."_

Drishti is an AI-powered smart glasses solution aimed at empowering the blind and visually impaired to navigate the world around them. Through innovative features and community-building capabilities, Drishti enhances accessibility and fosters inclusivity.

## Leading Causes of Blindness
- Mascular Degeneration
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts

## Problems faced by visually impaired
- Reading Impairement
- Limited navigation in enclosed areas.
- Difficulty recognizing distant people/objects
- Decision-making hindered by environmental factors
- Dependency on physical presence for assistance
- Lack of contextual visual information


## Statistics:
- Approximately 2.2 billion people globally were predicted to be blind or visually impaired in 2019, with nearly 1 billion affected by avoidable conditions.
- Efforts in global health policies, preventative measures, and accessible eye care are crucial to address these issues.
  

## Economic Burden:
- Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden, with an estimated annual productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion.
- Drishti aims to address the economic burden by providing an affordable alternative to existing solutions.


## Digital Anonymity in Drishti

### Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR):
Drishti prioritizes digital anonymity by securely managing Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of visually impaired individuals.
By adopting robust encryption techniques and access controls, Drishti ensures the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive health information, promoting digital anonymity and compliance with healthcare regulations.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication:
Drishti facilitates peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between visually impaired users and volunteers, fostering collaboration and support within a secure and private environment.
Through end-to-end encrypted P2P communication channels, Drishti enables real-time assistance and information sharing while preserving digital anonymity and protecting user privacy
  

## Our Solution:
#### READ Feature:
Drishti's READ feature utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert text into context-based audio, enabling users to listen to text-based content such as mail, signboards, recipes, and more.
This feature ensures that visually impaired individuals can access and comprehend textual information in their environment effortlessly.
#### Scene Analysis:
Drishti provides a brief description of surroundings through scene analysis, enhancing situational awareness for users.
This capability allows users to gain a better understanding of their environment, improving their ability to navigate and interact with the world around them.
#### Vision-based Authorization System:
Drishti has developed a unique and dynamic vision-based authorization system, ensuring secure access to the device and its features.
This authentication mechanism utilizes advanced vision algorithms to authenticate users, providing a seamless and secure user experience.
#### Indoor Navigation System (INS):
Drishti's Indoor Navigation System (INS) assists users in navigating indoor environments with ease and efficiency.
By leveraging real-time location data and navigation algorithms, Drishti guides users through complex indoor spaces, enhancing their mobility and independence.
#### POV Vision Streaming Application:
Drishti offers a Point-of-View (POV) vision streaming application that enables location-based volunteer selection with live location and video streaming.
This feature allows visually impaired individuals to connect with volunteers within a specific radius, facilitating real-time assistance and support.
#### Multilingual Support:
Drishti supports over 40 languages, including regional languages, ensuring accessibility for users worldwide.
This multilingual support enhances the inclusivity of Drishti, catering to the diverse linguistic needs of visually impaired individuals across different regions.

## Connecting user and volunteers
To help with navigating, people can connect with visually challenged people within a radius of 100 meter to 1.5 kilometres. We respect these people's right to privacy, thus we only share information that is absolutely necessary. And through a video conversation with the user, the volunteers can assist them. The ability for volunteers to create checkpoints in the surrounding areas is one of the application's best features. For instance, if there is road construction, the volunteer can mark the location and let the blinds here have an alert while they are travelling by.

- Envision Glasses cost over 2,00,000 Rs, while Drishti costs approximately 5,000 Rs.
- Envision Glasses subscription costs over 12,000 Rs per month, whereas Drishti costs approximately 500-800 Rs.
- Drishti's modular design ensures better after-sales support and cost-effectiveness.

## Hardware Specification:
### Raspberry Pi Zero 2W:
The Raspberry Pi Zero 2W is a compact and affordable single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
It features a Processor Broadcom BCM2710A1, 1GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU.
The upgraded processor offers up to 40% faster single-threaded performance and five times faster multi-threaded performance compared to the original Raspberry Pi Zero.
Its compact size and powerful capabilities make it ideal for wearable technology applications like Drishti.
### ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT:
The ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications.
It is developed based on WM8960, a low-power stereo codec, and features two microphones on both sides of the board for collecting sounds.
Additionally, it provides 3 APA102 RGB LEDs, 1 User Button, and 2 on-board Grove interfaces for expanding applications.
The board supports 3.5mm Audio Jack or JST 2.0 Speaker Out for audio output.
With its capabilities in capturing and processing voice commands or other audio inputs, the ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT is integral to the functionality of Drishti's voice-controlled interface for hands-free operation.
## Feasibility:
- Drishti's cost-effectiveness and innovative features make it a feasible solution for the visually impaired.
- Regular updates and support ensure security and efficiency.
