_"Empowering the blind to navigate a sightless world â€“ because every journey begins with a step, even if taken in the dark."_

Drishti is an AI-powered smart glasses solution aimed at empowering the blind and visually impaired to navigate the world around them. Through innovative features and community-building capabilities, Drishti enhances accessibility and fosters inclusivity.

## Leading Causes of Blindness

- Mascular Degeneartion
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts

## Problems faced by visually impaired
- Reading Impairement
- Limited navigation in enclosed areas.
- Difficulty recognizing distant people/objects
- Decision-making hindered by environmental factors
- Dependency on physical presence for assistance
- Lack of contextual visual information

## Statistics:
- Approximately 2.2 billion people globally were predicted to be blind or visually impaired in 2019, with nearly 1 billion affected by avoidable conditions.
- Efforts in global health policies, preventative measures, and accessible eye care are crucial to address these issues.

## Economic Burden:
- Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden, with an estimated annual productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion.
- Drishti aims to address the economic burden by providing an affordable alternative to existing solutions.

## Our Solution:
- **READ:** Converts text to context-based audio using OCR, enabling users to listen to text-based content.
- **Scene Analysis:** Provides a brief description of surroundings, enhancing situational awareness.
- **Vision-based Authorization System:** Offers a unique and dynamic system for user authentication.
- **Indoor Navigation System (INS):** Helps users navigate indoor environments efficiently.
- **POV Vision Streaming Application:** Allows location-based volunteer selection with live location and video streaming.
- **Multilingual Support:** Supports 40+ languages, including regional languages, enhancing accessibility.
  
## Connecting user and volunteers

To help with navigating, people can connect with visually challenged people within a radius of 100 meter to 1.5 kilometres. We respect these people's right to privacy, thus we only share information that is absolutely necessary. And through a video conversation with the user, the volunteers can assist them. The ability for volunteers to create checkpoints in the surrounding areas is one of the application's best features. For instance, if there is road construction, the volunteer can mark the location and let the blinds here have an alert while they are travelling by.

## Economizing:
- Drishti costs approximately 2.5% of what our closest competitor, Envision Glasses, charges.
- Envision Glasses cost over 2,00,000 Rs, while Drishti costs approximately 5,000 Rs.
- Envision Glasses subscription costs over 12,000 Rs per month, whereas Drishti costs approximately 500-800 Rs.
- Drishti's modular design ensures better after-sales support and cost-effectiveness.

## Hardware Specification:
### Raspberry Pi Zero 2W:
The Raspberry Pi Zero 2W is a compact and affordable single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
It features a Processor Broadcom BCM2710A1, 1GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU.
The upgraded processor offers up to 40% faster single-threaded performance and five times faster multi-threaded performance compared to the original Raspberry Pi Zero.
Its compact size and powerful capabilities make it ideal for wearable technology applications like Drishti.
### ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT:
The ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications.
It is developed based on WM8960, a low-power stereo codec, and features two microphones on both sides of the board for collecting sounds.
Additionally, it provides 3 APA102 RGB LEDs, 1 User Button, and 2 on-board Grove interfaces for expanding applications.
The board supports 3.5mm Audio Jack or JST 2.0 Speaker Out for audio output.
With its capabilities in capturing and processing voice commands or other audio inputs, the ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT is integral to the functionality of Drishti's voice-controlled interface for hands-free operation.
## Feasibility:
- Drishti's cost-effectiveness and innovative features make it a feasible solution for the visually impaired.
- Regular updates and support ensure security and efficiency.

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- GPT-4
- Respeaker Pi-Hat
- Raspberry Pi ZERO 2W
- Flutter

## Conclusion:
Drishti is not just a smart glasses solution; it's a transformative tool that empowers the visually impaired, fosters human connection, and paves the way for a brighter future. With its affordability, innovative features, and commitment to inclusivity, Drishti stands as a beacon of hope in navigating a sightless world.

In the context of AI smart glasses, the ReSpeaker Audio Pi HAT could be utilized to capture and process voice commands or other audio inputs. This is particularly useful if the smart glasses incorporate a voice-controlled interface for hands-free operation
